% function [correlationTimeSeries,normalizationTimeSeries] =
% WaveletMatchedFilter(fluxTimeSeries,h0,transitPulse,varianceWindowLength)
%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
% Description: This function returns the wavelet expansion of the input signal
%
% Input:
%     1. fluxTimeSeries: stellar flux with possible planetary transit
%        signature
%     2. h0: scaling filter coefficients (an example: Daubechies 12 tap)
%     3. transitPulse: trial transit pulse (an example: 3 hour rectangular
%        pulse represented as -ones(6,1), where the cadence duration is ~30
%        minutes)
%     4. varianceWindowLength: length of the window over which variance
%        estimation is carried out in the wavelet domain
%     5. mScale: number of stages in filter bank (optional)
%     6. currentTransitModelCurve - additional timeseries (current transit
%        model fit) to be whitened for iterative model fit (optional)
%     7. whiteningCoefficientsIn - set of precomputed whitening coefficients 
%        for each band (including DC).  These are used instead of
%        computed coefficients whenever present.  (optional)  
%
% Output:
%      1. correlationTimeSeries (see the references listed below):
%         measures the correlation between the flux time series and the
%         transit pulse at every cadence in the wavelet domain
%      2. normalizationTimeSeries (see the references listed below):
%         measures the noise power over a moving window of length
%         'varianceWindowLength' at every cadence in the wavelet domain
%      3. whitenedTimeSeries - 2-d array containing the whitened versions
%         of the flux time series, traial transit pulse, and current model
%         transit pulse (if present in inputs); whitenedTimeSeries(:,1) 
%         is the whitened flux time series, (:,2) is the transit pulse,
%         (:,3) is the whitened current model transit curve.
%      4. whiteningCoefficientsOut - whitening coefficients at each band -
%         dimensions [nLength, mScale] (DC band included)

% Comments:
%     This function (qwavsearch.m)is part of the transitgame.m matlab
%     software written by Jon Jenkins that demonstrated the effectiveness
%     of wavelet based matched filter based detection algorithm in
%     extracting transit signatures buried in the DIARAD/SOHO solar
%     irradiance measurements corrupted by instrumental and shot noise. It
%     combines overcomplete wavelet transform and matched filter detection
%     and forms the expected detection statistics in the same function to
%     conserve memory.
