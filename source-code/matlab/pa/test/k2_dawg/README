This directory contains supplemental DAWG tools for characterizing K2 data 
products. In addition to the existing Kepler DAWG tools, new tools have 
been added for analyzing agreement of motion polynomials and centroids, 
the effect of roll tweaks on raw light curves, cosmic ray corrections, 
and the quality of Argabrightening mitigation.

===========================================================================

                              Contents

===========================================================================
k2_pa_dawg_metrics_script.m

    This is the main K2 DAWG script, which calls many of the other 
    functions listed here. Typically it is called as follows:

    k2_pa_dawg_metrics_script(k2_configure_pa_dawg_script)

k2_configure_pa_dawg_script.m

    The top section of this function should be modified by the user for 
    each new campaign. 


Motion Polynomials & Centroids
==============================
plot_mp_centroid_residuals_fov.m
	
	Generate a color-coded FOV plot of the distances between motion 
	polynomial-predicted centroid positions and the computed centroid 
	positions (either PRF or flux-weighted) for PPA and/or non-PPA
	targets.

summarize_mp_centroid_residuals.m

	Used by plot_mp_centroid_residuals_fov.m. Compute an arbitrary function
	of the residual errors between motion polynomial-predicted centroid 
	positions and the centroid positions determined by either PRF fitting
	or spatial averaging of observed flux.

plot_mp_centroid_stats_fov.m

    Examine the number of centroids used in motion polynomial computation 
    for each channel at each cadence and plot statistics across the FOV. 
    Also examine the results of RA/Dec fitting for each channel. 

compare_motion_polynomials.m

	Compare two sets of motion polynomials.


Raw Light Curves
================
plot_detrended_flux_attribute_fov.m

    Generate a color-coded FOV plot of a user-defined attribute (standard
    deviation by default) of detrended light curves for a given quarter or 
    campaign. The result for each target is plotted at the location of its
    flux-weighted centroid.


Cosmic Ray
==========
generate_cosmic_ray_lc_figs_and_data.m

    Analyze the distribution of detected background cosmic rays for each 
    channel. Compare the distribution of detected events with the expected
    distribution and plot (1) the goodness-of-fit across the FOV, and (2) 
    the expected and observed histogram for each channel.


Argabrightening Mitigation
==========================
plot_argabrightening_mitigation.m

    Generate a plot of mean calibrated background flux for all specified 
    channels with Argabrightening cadences marked.

PA-COA 
======
Image Modeling:
--------------
scoop_ra_dec_mag_fit_results_fov.m

    Aggregates PA-COA magnitude/position fitting results from PA state 
    files into a signle struct array.

plot_modeled_vs_catalog_ra_dec_mag_fov.m

    Generate plots of the differences from catalog values of fitted 
    target positions and magnitudes.

scatter_plot_ra_dec_mag_results.m

    A general plotting tool for explorign the results of magnitude and 
    position fitting in PA-COA.

Aperture Selection:
------------------
convert_cdpp_fov_struct_to_target_array.m
add_aperture_sizes_and_target_positions.m

    These two fucntion work together to transform results from 
    paCoaClass.compile_FOV_statistics() into a more convenient format.

plot_aperture_sizes.m

    Plot the sizes of the PA optimal aperture actually used for photometry
    against those (from TAD) in the PA input structures.


===========================================================================

                              Usage

===========================================================================
The following is a step-by-step account of how to generate DAWG figures and
data using the tools in this directory:

1) Add this directory to the Matlab path, so that the scripts herein are
   visible.

2) Add test directories to the Matlab path.

   	>> addpath('/path/to/matlab/pa/test')
   	>> addpath('/path/to/matlab/pa/test/k2_dawg')

3) Create a directory within which to store V&V figures and data, and make 
   it the current working Matlab directory.

	>> mkdir('c3_dawg')
	>> cd c3_dawg

4) Modify the function k2_configure_pa_dawg_script.m

5) Run the function k2_pa_dawg_metrics_script() with the config struct 
   returned by k2_configure_pa_dawg_script() as an argument.

	>> k2_pa_dawg_metrics_script(k2_configure_pa_dawg_script)
