% OUTPUTS
%     kernel : A kernelWidth-by-kernelWidth matrix containing the
%              difference of two sampled 2D Gaussian functions.
%
%              kernel(r,c) = (a + 1) * g1(r,c) - a * g2(r,c)

%              
%              g1(v) = b(C1) * exp(-0.5 * (v - mu)' * inv(C1) * (v - mu))
%              g2(v) = b(C2) * exp(-0.5 * (v - mu)' * inv(C2) * (v - mu))

%              
%              a      : Mixing coefficient for the two Gaussians.
%              v      : A (row, col) vector
%              mu     : The mean (row,col) position vector
%              C1     : Covariance matrix of g1.
%              C2     : Covariance matrix of g2.
%              stdRow : Standard deviation of g1 in the row direction.

%              kRow   : Proportionality constant relating the standard
%                       deviation of g2 in the row direction to that of g1.
%              kCol   : Proportionality constant relating the standard
%                       deviation of g2 in the column direction to that of
%                       g1. 
%              p      : Correlation coefficient in the range [-1.0, 1.0].
%                       Same for both g1 and g2.
%
%              Rows and column variables are assumed to be continuous and
%              real-valued unless otherwise stated.
%
% NOTES
%   - In order to keep the filters in the family of sharpening/blurring
%     filters, the propostionality constants should be limited to the range
%     [1, inf).
%   - When the mixing coefficient is 0, the result is a single 2D gaussian
%     blur
