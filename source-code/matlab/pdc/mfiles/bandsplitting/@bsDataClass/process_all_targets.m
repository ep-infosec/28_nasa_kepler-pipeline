% NOTE:
% having a loop here is not really elegant.
% but otherwise an enormous amount of memory would be required temporarily.
% (which is feasible on a work station, but leads to memory fragmentation and possible instabilities if oom)
% the following methods can easily be changed to work on all targets: (simply adding a loop over n)
% - pre_transform_conditioning()
% - split_into_bands()
% - post_transform_conditioning()
% - group_bands()
