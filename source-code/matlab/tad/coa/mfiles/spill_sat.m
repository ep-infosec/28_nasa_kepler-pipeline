%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Function Name: spillsat
%
% Modification History - This can be managed by a revision control system
%
% Software level: Research Code
%
% Description: Takes excess charge in pixels over a certain saturation
% value and spreads it up and down the column of the array
%
% Input: ccd:  the ccd array with (possibly) over-saturated pixels
%        satval:  the maximum 'allowed' value of a  pixel
%
% Output: ccd:  the ccd array with properly 'spilled' charge
%
% Question:  what happens when it 'spills' off the edge of the array?
%
% Notes/errata: "Up" is toward 1 and "Down" is toward mccd
