% determine if two aperture definitions are equal by direct comparison of
% aperture images
%
% inputs: 
%   apDef1, apDef2 aperture structures containing the fields 
%       .offset array of structures containing the fields
%           .row, column row, column offset of each offset entry
%
% output: boolean result = 1 if apertures are equal, 0 otherwise
