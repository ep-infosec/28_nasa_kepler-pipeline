The following functions can be run via the "make doc" command. Their
output can be viewed in build/doc. 


run_depfun.m

Uses the MATLAB depfun function to produce dependency graphs. Both
textual outlines and graphs are produced. The run_depfun documentation
lists an indexFilename parameter; the Makefile template rules.mk
specifies depfun-list for this parameter. See the run_depfun and
depfun documentation for more information.

The graphs require the Graphviz software (http://www.graphviz.org/).
To install the Graphviz software run "yum -i graphviz".

If it ever becomes necessary to use the upstream version of Graphviz
because the version that comes with Fedora is insufficient, add the
following to /etc/yum.repos.d/graphviz.repo to obtain it.

    name=Graphviz - Fedora $releasever - $basearch
    baseurl=http://www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz/stable/redhat/fc$releasever/$basearch/os/
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0


run_publish.m

Uses the MATLAB publish function to produce HTML documentation. See
the publish and run_publish documentation for more information.

The documentation lists an indexFilename parameter; the Makefile
template rules.mk specifies publish-list for this parameter. An HTML
file will be produced for each function listed in this file.
