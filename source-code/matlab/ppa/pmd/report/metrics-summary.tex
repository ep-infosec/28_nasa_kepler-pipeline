PPA Metric Determination (PMD) Tracking Alerts. The color coding of
the boxes indicates the following:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0ex}
\setlength{\parsep}{0ex}
\item Green:  Metric is within all bounds at all times
\item Yellow: Metric exceeds adaptive bounds
\item Red:    Metric exceeds fixed bounds
\item Cyan:   Metric information is missing
\end{itemize}
