The centroid bias map is a quiver plot (velocity plot) that displays
\{row centroid bias, column centroid bias\} as arrows at the positions
\{ra, dec\} of stars. For example, the first vector is defined by
components \{row centroid bias(1), column centroid bias(1)\} and is
displayed at the point \{ra(1), dec(1)\}.

In this plot, the quivers/arrows are plotted without automatic
scaling. The measured centroid positions \{centroid rows, centroid
columns\} on the focal plane are transformed to \{ra, dec\} using
pix\_2\_ra\_dec at the nominal attitude.

The centroid bias components are computed in units of (1/10th) of
pixel (1 pixel spans 3.98 arc sec) as

\begin{verbatim}
    u = (ra - raCatalog)*(3600/3.98)*cos(deg2rad(decCatalog))*10 
    v = (dec - decCatalog)*(3600/3.98)*10
\end{verbatim}

The length of the arrows are in units of 1/10th of a pixel. This means
a quiver/arrow with a length equal to 1 tick mark spacing in x or y
axis will equal 5*(1/10) = 0.5 pixel ( x- axis markers are 5 degrees
apart).
