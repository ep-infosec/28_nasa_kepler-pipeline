function prefixStrings = plot_fpg_fit_results( fitterArgs, parValues, covariance )
%
% PLOT_FPG_FIT_RESULTS -- plot the results of a focal plane geometry fit.
%
% prefixStrings = plot_fpg_fit_results( fitterArgs, parValues, covariance ) produces a 
%    standardized plot of the results of the FPG fit.  The parValues are plotted with
%    error bars from the covariance matrix; parameters which are missing from the fit are
%    shown with red dots. The error bar sizes are also plotted in a separate set of bar
%    plots, since otherwise the error bars can be too small to be seen on the scale of the
%    plot.  The plotted data is converted via engineering notation, and the resulting
%    prefix strings are returned in the prefixStrings cell array.
