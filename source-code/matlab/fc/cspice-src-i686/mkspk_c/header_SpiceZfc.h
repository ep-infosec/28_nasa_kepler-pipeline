-Version

   - C-SPICELIB Version 5.0.0, 06-MAR-2005 (NJB)

        Added typedefs for pointers to functions.  This change was
        made to support CSPICE wrappers for geometry finder routines.

        Added typedefs for the SUN-SOLARIS-64BIT-GCC_C
        environment (these are identical to those for the 
        ALPHA-DIGITAL-UNIX_C environment).

   - C-SPICELIB Version 4.1.0, 24-MAY-2001 (WLT)

        Moved the #ifdef __cplusplus so that it appears after the
        typedefs.  This allows us to more easily wrap CSPICE in a
        namespace for C++.

   - C-SPICELIB Version 4.0.0, 09-FEB-1999 (NJB)  
   
        Updated to accommodate the Alpha/Digital Unix platform.
        Also updated to support inclusion in C++ code.
                  
   - C-SPICELIB Version 3.0.0, 02-NOV-1998 (NJB)  
   
        Updated for SPICELIB version N0049.
        
   - C-SPICELIB Version 2.0.0, 15-SEP-1997 (NJB)  
   
        Changed variable name "typeid" to "typid" in prototype
        for zzfdat_.  This was done to enable compilation under
        Borland C++.
        
   - C-SPICELIB Version 1.0.0, 15-SEP-1997 (NJB) (KRG)

   Include Files:

   Many of the prototypes below use data types defined by f2c.  We
   copy here the f2c definitions that occur in prototypes of functions
   produced by running f2c on Fortran SPICELIB routines.
   
   The reason we don't simply conditionally include f2c.h itself here
   is that f2c.h defines macros that conflict with stdlib.h on some
   systems.  It's simpler to just replicate the few typedefs we need.
