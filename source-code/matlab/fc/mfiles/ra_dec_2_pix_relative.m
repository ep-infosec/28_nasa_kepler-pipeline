% [module output row column] = ra_dec_2_pix_relative(ra, dec, mjds, deltaRaPointing, deltaDecPointing, deltaRollPointing, aberrateFlag)
%
% Returns the pixelspace positions of the N sky coordinates specified by (ra, dec), at the M times specified by mjds.
% The raPointing, decPointing, and rollPointing must be the same length as mjds.
% The size of the outputs will be NxM.
%
% INPUTS:
%   ra  -- The RA of the sky coordindate(s) in degrees.  A one-or-more element vector with a length the same size as dec.
%   dec -- The RA of the sky coordindate(s) in degrees.  A one-or-more element vector with a length the same size as ra.
%   mjds --The MJD for the coordinate transformation.  Must be the same size as raPointing, decPointing, and rollPointing.  
%   raPointing --The pointing RA of the spacecraft for the vector of Julian dates given in the mjds argument.  Must be the same size as mjds. This is relative to the FC model's pointing.
%   decPointing --The pointing declination of the spacecraft for the vector of modified Julian dates given in the mjds argument.  Must be the same size as mjds. This is relative to the FC model's pointing.
%   rollPointing --The pointing roll of the spacecraft for the vector of modified Julian dates given in the mjds argument.  Must be the same size as mjds. This is relative to the FC model's pointing.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   module -- the Kepler CCD module the sky coordinate falls upon.  The size of this output is NxM, where N is the length of ra, and M is the length of mjds.
%   output -- the Kepler CCD outupt the sky coordinate falls upon.  The size of this output is NxM, where N is the length of ra, and M is the length of mjds.
%   row -- the Kepler pixel row the sky coordinate falls upon.  The size of this output is NxM, where N is the length of ra, and M is the length of mjds.
%   column -- the Kepler CCD column the sky coordinate falls upon.  The size of this output is NxM, where N is the length of ra, and M is the length of mjds.
% 
%   N.B.: The row and column outputs are on the accumulation memory silicon (they include the collateral regions). 
%
%         If the instance of the raDec2PixObject that is being executed is zero-based (as determined by the constructor
%         argument and the is_zero_based(raDec2PixObject) method) the center of the science pixel closest to the readout
%         node is (20.0, 12.0), and the center of the first pixel in accumulation memory is (0.0, 0.0).
%
%         If the instance of the raDec2PixObject that is being executed is one-based (as determined by the constructor
%         argument and the is_one_based(raDec2PixObject) method) the center of the science pixel closest to the readout
%         node is (21.0, 13.0), and the center of the first pixel in accumulation memory is (1.0, 1.0).
