% [ra dec] = pix_2_ra_dec_relative(module, output, row, column, mjds, deltaRaPointing, deltaDecPointing, deltaRollPointing, aberrateFlag)
%
% Returns the sky coordinate positions of the N pixel locations specified by (module, output, row, column), at the M times specified by mjds.
% The raPointing, decPointing, and rollPointing must be the same length as mjds.
% The size of the outputs will be NxM.
%
% INPUTS:
%   module-- The module of the pixel coordindate(s).  A one-or-more element vector with a length the same size as output.
%   output-- The output of the pixel coordindate(s).  A one-or-more element vector with a length the same size as module.
%   row-- The row of the pixel coordindate(s).  A one-or-more element vector with a length the same size as module.
%   column-- The column of the pixel coordindate(s).  A one-or-more element vector with a length the same size as module.
%   mjds --The modified julian date of for the coordinate transformation.  Must be the same size as raPointing, decPointing, and rollPointing.  
%   raPointing --The pointing RA of the spacecraft for the vector of MJDs in the mjds argument.  This is relative to the FC pointing model. Must be the same size as mjds.  
%   decPointing --The pointing declination of the spacecraft for the vector of MJDs in the mjds argument.  This is relative to the FC pointing model. Must be the same size as mjds.
%   rollPointing --The pointing roll of the spacecraft for the vector of Julian dates given in the mjds argument.  This is relative to the FC pointing model. Must be the same size as mjds.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   ra -- the RA the pixel coordinate falls upon, in degrees.  The size of this output is NxM, where N is the length of module, and M is the length of mjds.
%   dec -- the Kepler CCD outupt the sky coordinate falls upon, in degrees.  The size of this output is NxM, where N is the length of module, and M is the length of mjds.
% 
%   N.B.: The row and column outputs are on the accumulation memory silicon (they include the collateral regions). 
%
%         If the instance of the raDec2PixObject that is being executed is zero-based (as determined by the constructor
%         argument and the is_zero_based(raDec2PixObject) method) the center of the science pixel closest to the readout
%         node is (20.0, 12.0), and the center of the first pixel in accumulation memory is (0.0, 0.0).
%
%         If the instance of the raDec2PixObject that is being executed is one-based (as determined by the constructor
%         argument and the is_one_based(raDec2PixObject) method) the center of the science pixel closest to the readout
%         node is (21.0, 13.0), and the center of the first pixel in accumulation memory is (1.0, 1.0).
