%
% test_transitGeneratorCollectionClass_set_geometric_model -- unit test for the set method of the transitGeneratorCollectionClass with geometric transit model
%
% test_transitGeneratorCollectionClass_set_geometric_model tests the following features of the set method for the transitGeneratorCollectionClass:
%
% ==> incorrect dimension for the planetModel argument generates an error
% ==> setting the planetModel produces the correct return value for getting the planet model
%
% This is a unit test in the mlunit context.  To execute just this unit test, use the following syntax:
%
%   run(text_test_runner, testTransitGeneratorCollectionClass('test_transitGeneratorCollectionClass_set_geometric_model'));
