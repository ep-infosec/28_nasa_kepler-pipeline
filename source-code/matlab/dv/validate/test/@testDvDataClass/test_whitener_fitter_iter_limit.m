% test_whitener_fitter_fit_iter_limit -- test
% perform_iterative_whitening_and_model_fitting method of dvDataClass for cases in which
% the iteration limit is reached
%
% This unit test exercises the following functionality of the dvDataClass method which
% performs the iterative whitening and fitting of the flux time series:
%
% ==> Exits with an error when the iteration limit is exceeded.
%
% This test is intended to be executed in the mlunit context.  For standalone execution
% use the following syntax:
%
%      run(text_test_runner, testDvDataClass('test_whitener_fitter_iter_limit'));
