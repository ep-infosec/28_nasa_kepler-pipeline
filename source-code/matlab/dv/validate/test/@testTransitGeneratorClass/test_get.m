%
% test_get -- test the transitGeneratorClass get method
%
% This unit test exercises the 3 use-cases for the get(transitGeneratorClass, '...') method:
%
% ==> 'help' or '?' : returns a list of members
% ==> '*'           : returns a struct with all the members
% ==> 'memberName'  : returns the named member of the object.
%
%
% This test is intended to be executed in the mlunit context.  For standalone execution
% use the following syntax:
%
%      run(text_test_runner, testTransitGeneratorClass('test_get'));
