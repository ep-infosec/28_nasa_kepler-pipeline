%
% test_set_par_values_in_transit_generator -- unit test for the transitFitClass method
% set_par_values_in_transit_generator
%
% This method performs the unit test which sets parameter values into a
% transitGeneratorClass object (it's actually a private method of the transitFitClass).
% The functionality which is tested is as follows:
%
% ==> The parameter values passed to the method wind up as planetModel values in the
%     transitGeneratorClass object
% ==> The correct action is taken for fitType values 0, 1, and 2
% ==> Negative-valued parameters are inserted into the transitGeneratorClass as positive
%     values.
%
% This test is intended to be executed in the mlunit context.  For standalone execution
% use the following syntax:
%
%      run(text_test_runner, testTransitFitClass('test_set_par_values_in_transit_generator'));
