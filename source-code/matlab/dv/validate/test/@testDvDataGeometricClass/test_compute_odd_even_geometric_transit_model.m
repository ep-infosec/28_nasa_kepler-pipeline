% test_compute_odd_even_geometric_transit_model -- unit test of dvDataClass private method compute_odd_even_transit_model
%
% This unit test exercises the following functionality of the dvDataClass private method compute_odd_even_transit_model:
%
% ==> An odd-transits model matches the original all-transits model except for the planet model, which matches the fit parameters used to construct the model
% ==> An even-transits model is identical to the equivalent odd-transits model, except that the transit epoch is changed by 1 orbital period
% ==> when called with oddEvenFlag == 3, an error is thrown.
%
% This test is intended to be executed in the mlunit context.  For standalone execution use the following syntax:
%
%      run(text_test_runner, testDvDataGeometricClass('test_compute_odd_even_geometric_transit_model'));
