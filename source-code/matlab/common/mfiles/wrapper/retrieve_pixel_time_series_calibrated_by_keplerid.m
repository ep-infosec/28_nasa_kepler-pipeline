% The long/short cadence target time series extractor retrieves the original or
% calibrated time series of the long or short cadence target data for a
% specified vector of kepler IDs in a given time interval.
%
% Coordinate System Note:
%   Since this wrapper is presenting data from java, the row and column
%   coordinates given here are zero-based (i.e., the pixel nearest to the
%   readout node has coordinates row=0, column=0.
%
% INPUTS:
%   keplerIds               A list of the desired keplerIds.  One or more
%                           must be specified.
%
%   startMjd               The MJD of the start of the desired time interval.  
%
%   endMjd                 The MJD of the end of the desired time interval. 
%
%   getLongCadence         If 1, long cadence data is retrieved, if 0, short calibrated data is received.  Defaults to 1.
%
%   getCollateralAndBackground If 1, collateral and background data is retreived.  If 0, collateral and background data is skipped.  Defaults to 0.
