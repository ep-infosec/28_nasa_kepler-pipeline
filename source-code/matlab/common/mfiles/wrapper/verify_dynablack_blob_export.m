function errCount = verify_dynablack_blob_export(varargin)
% function errCount = verify_dynablack_blob_export(varargin)
% 
% This function checks the renamed dynablack blobs for consistancy between blob contents and filename assuming the exported dynablack blob
% filename format is (per KSOC-4888), i.e. kplr<YYYYDOYHHMMSS>-q<##>-<mmo>-dr<##>_dynablack.mat. An message is displayed to stdout and the
% errCount is incremented if a blob file is detected with an inconsistancy.
% 
% INPUTS:   varargin    == (optional) 
%                           [string] path to exported blob files. Terminate with separator.
%                           i.e. '/path/to/ksop-2440-export/export-dynablack/'
%                           If path is not specified the tool will search the run directory for blobs matching the filename format.
% OUTPUTS:  errCount    ==  [double] Count of files whose quarter, module or output contents do not match the identifiers in the filename.
%
% This function assumes that /path/to/matlab/common/mfiles is included in the MATLAB path.
