% function val = bound ( val, lower, upper )

% Bind input vector val to be within [lower, upper] by adding or subtracting
% upper-lower to each element out of bounds, until all elements are within the
% range.  Returns the bounded vector.
%
% NOTE This may have undocumented edge effects resulting
% in values where val==upper or val==lower.
