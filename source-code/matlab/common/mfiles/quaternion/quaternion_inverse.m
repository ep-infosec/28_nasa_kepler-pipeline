function quatAInverse = quaternion_inverse(quatA)

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% function quatAInverse = quaternion_inverse(quatA)
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% The inverse of a quaternion is defined in a way that p(âˆ’1)p = 1. It is
% formed the same way that the complex inverse is found:
%
%       p(-1) = p* / (p* p)
%
% where p(-1) is the inverse (reciprocal) and p* is the conjugate.
%
% The product of a quaternion and its conjugate is a scalar. The division
% of a quaternion by a scalar is equivalent to multiplication by the scalar
% inverse, such that each element of the quaternion is divided by the
% divisor.
