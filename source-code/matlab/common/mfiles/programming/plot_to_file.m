% Summary
%
% Segmentation violation when exporting a figure on a Unix/Linux Machine
% Description
%
% A segmentation violation occurs when printing a figure with a large number of lines to a vector format, for  example, when exporting this plot:
%
%     SIZE=100000;
%     x(SIZE)=0;
%     y(SIZE)=0;
%     h=figure;
%     hold on;
%     for a=1:25
%         for b=1:SIZE
%             x(1,b)=b;
%             y(1,b)=a+b;
%         end
%         plot(x,y,'r*');
%     end
%     hold off;
%    print -dps test.ps;
%
% Workaround
%
% Use another renderer when printing, for example z-buffer.

% Printing and Exporting without a Display
%
%
% On a UNIX platform (including Macintosh), where you can start MATLAB in
% nodisplay mode (matlab -nodisplay), you can print using most of the
% drivers you can use with a display and export to most of the same file
% formats. The PostScript and Ghostscript devices all function in nodisplay
% mode on UNIX. The graphic devices -djpeg, -dpng, -dtiff (compressed TIFF
% bitmaps) and -tiff (EPS with TIFF preview) work as well, but under
% nodisplay they use Ghostscript to generate output instead of using the
% drivers built into MATLAB. However, Ghostscript ignores the -r option
% when generating -djpeg, -dpng, -dtiff and -tiff image files. This means
% that you cannot vary the resolution of image files when running in
% nodisplay mode.
% To ensure that the printed output matches what you see on the screen,
% print using the -zbuffer option. To obtain higher resolution (for
% example, to make text look better), use the -r option to increase the
% resolution. There is, however, a tradeoff between the resolution and the
% size of the created PostScript file, which can be quite large at higher
% resolutions. The default resolution of 150 dpi generally produces good
% results.
% You can reduce the size of the output file by making the figure smaller
% before printing it and setting the figure PaperPositionMode to auto, or
% by just setting the PaperPosition property to a smaller size.
