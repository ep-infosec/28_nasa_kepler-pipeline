% This is a driver script to run process_K2_thruster_firing_data_TFR.m
% directly on the data from the thruster firing data report provided by OPS.

% Produces the .csv output file for nexsci and writes it directly into the
% archive directory specified by KSOP-2678 (for C9), 
% This file has three columns:
% column 1: cadenceTimes.cadenceNumbers
%   short or long cadence number; In some cases there might be missing cadences.
% column 2: thrusterFiringEvents.definiteThrusterActivityIndicators
%   logical indicator for known thruster firing activity during this cadence
% column 3: thrusterFiringEvents.possibleThrusterActivityIndicators];
%   logical indicator for possible thruster firing activity during this
%   cadence -- i.e. thruster firing activity can't be ruled out.

% Also produces .mat archive file that contains 
% thrusterFiringDataStruct, 
% thrusterFiringEvents, and
% cadenceTimes. See the code process_K2_thruster_firing_data_TFR.m for a
% complete description of these fields.

% Adapted from make_K2_thruster_firing_flags.m, which was used to produce
% output .csv files for C1 and C2 that were delivered to nexsci and are
% archived at http://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/thruster_firings/

% Note: If PA or PDC is available, we use cadenceTimes from PA or PDC.
% If not, cadenceTimes data is taken from the header files, posted
% on the KSOC ticket by OPS.

% For C9 and C10 we don't run PA or PDC, so we must get the cadence data from
% the header files, posted by OPS on the ticket KSOC-4994, KSOC-5121
% respectively.
