%% includeSingleGraphics
%
% includeSingleGraphics[opt_includegraphics_args]{image}
%
% Include a graphics file with caption that has been created with the
% report_add_figure function.
%
% The first argument contains a macro that was returned by the
% report_add_figure function. This macro is used to obtain the actual
% basename of the image file. A caption is also obtained by
% concatenating the macro with ``Caption''.
%
% If the image file is not present, the message ``The figure #2.png is
% not available.''
%
% The optional argument is used to override the default argument of
% width=\imagewidth to the call to includegraphics.

%% includeMultipleGraphics
%
% includeMultipleGraphics[opt_includegraphics_args]{images}{pattern}
%
% Include a number of graphics files with captions that have been
% created with the report_add_figure function.
%
% The first argument contains a comma-separated list of macros that
% were returned by the report_add_figure function. These macros are
% used to obtain the actual basename of the image file. A caption is
% also obtained by concatenating the macro with ``Caption''.
%
% The second argument contains the name of the pattern that was used
% to ascertain the image filenames. This is used to display a message
% ``No figures named #2 are available.'' if the first argument is
% empty. If several patterns were used, ensure that the resulting
% sentence is grammatically correct (for example, the second argument
% could be 'foo*, bar*, and baz*').
%
% The optional argument is used to override the default argument of
% width=\imagewidth to the call to includegraphics.
