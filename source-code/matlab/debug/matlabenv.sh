# Setup the environment to run executables that need the MATLAB runtime
#
# Other things I had to do:
#
# SELinux (if you have SELinux enabled):
#  permissions problem (Error: cannot restore segment prot after reloc: Permission denied):
#  find /path/to/mcr -name "*.so" -print -exec chcon -t texrel_shlib_t {} \;
#  or, in FC5, run system-config-securitylevel, SELinux tab, and check Compatibility->allow use of shared libs with text reloc
#
# Matlab compiler bug (MKL FATAL ERROR: libmkl_def.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory):
#  added $MCR_ROOT/bin/glnx86 to LD_LIBRARY_PATH (per http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/data/1-1DSP7F.html?product=CO&solution=1-1DSP7F)
