function view_raw_and_calibrated_ffi(rawFfiFilename, calFfiFilename, channel, ...
    colormapStr, plotFlag)
%
% function to view a raw and calibrated full frame image (FFI) side by side
% using smart_imagesc which scales the images appropriately
%
% INPUTS:
%
%   rawFfiFilename  filename of raw FFI
%   calFfiFilename  filename of SOC calibrated FFI
%   channel         [int] CCD channel (index to FFI)
%
% OPTIONAL INPUTS:
%   colormapStr     [string] colormap (default = 'hot')
%   plotFlag        [logical] flag to plot image to file (default = true)
%
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%   subplot with raw and calibrated images scaled with smart_imagesc
%   and with linked axes
