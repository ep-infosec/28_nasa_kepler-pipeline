function tempStruct = minimize_errorPropStructArray(tempStruct)
%
% Minimize space used by the errorPropStructArray (tempStruct) by
% eliminating duplicated structures/data and converting to sparse
% representations when it will save space.
%
% INPUT:    tempStruct  = nVariables x nCadences array of errorPropStruct
%                         with typically nIndices x 1 field arrays
% OUTPUT:   tempStruct  = nVariables x 1 array of errorPropStruct with
%                         typically nCadences x nIndices field arrays
