Steps to create DAWG Data Review Presentation    (Quintana 5/23/11)


(1) Run start_quarterly_cal_data_review.m for each month of LC/SC to create diagnostic 
    figures that are not generated in the Pipelime
   (a) for K2 check channels that have LC targets and SC targets
   (b) select month of processing you wish to highlight. Note, for NAS runs, all months are processed together

(2) Convert Matlab figures .fig to .png using ...cal/test/data_review/convert_dawg_figures_to_png.m

(3) Update the following Latex files:

report-inputs.sty (update quarter, sw release, and path to figures)
-or-
report-inputs_k2.sty (update quarter, sw release, and path to figures; check month to highlight)

DAWGIntroSlides.tex (change channels as needed)

channel-definition files: make sure files are present for the channels that were run

DAWGSummarySlides.tex (issues identified and future plans)
 
make_cal_dawg.tex: change to specify report_inputs.sty/report_inputs_k2.sty and check channel definitions

(4) run mreport
