Steps to create DAWG Data Review Presentation    (Quintana 5/23/11)


(1) Run start_quarterly_cal_data_review.m for each month of LC to create diagnostic 
    figures that are not generated in the Pipeline

e.g.
figureDir = '/path/to/calq15dawg/';
dataRootDir = '/path/to/q15-temp-nfs-issues/pipeline_results/q15-for-archive-ksop1546/lc/mpe_false/';
monthString = {'M1' 'M2' 'M3'};
cadenceType = 'long'
quarterString = 'Q15'
for i = 1:3
thisMonthString = monthString{i};
dbstop if error; start_quarterly_cal_data_review(figureDir, dataRootDir, quarterString, thisMonthString, cadenceType)
end


(2) Run start_quarterly_cal_data_review for each month of SC, *REMEMBERING TO CHANGE THE dataRootDir TO THE SC DIR!*

dataRootDir = {'/path/to/q15-temp-nfs-issues/pipeline_results/q15-for-archive-ksop1546/sc-m1/' '/path/to/q15-temp-nfs-issues/pipeline_results/q15-for-archive-ksop1546/sc-m2/' '/path/to/q15-temp-nfs-issues/pipeline_results/q15-for-archive-ksop1546/sc-m3/'}
cadenceType = 'short'
for i = 1:3
thisDataRootDir = dataRootDir{i};
thisMonthString = monthString{i};
dbstop if error; start_quarterly_cal_data_review(figureDir, thisDataRootDir, quarterString, thisMonthString, cadenceType)
end

(2) Convert Matlab figures .fig to .png using ...cal/test/data_review/convert_dawg_figures_to_png.m

(3) Update the following Latex files:

report-inputs.sty (update quarter, sw release, and path to figures)

DAWGIntroSlides.tex (include all channels)

DAWGSummarySlides.tex (issues identified and future plans)
 
(4) run mreport
