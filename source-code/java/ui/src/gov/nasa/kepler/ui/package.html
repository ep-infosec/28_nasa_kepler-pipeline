    <h3>Swing Application Framework</h3>

    <p>
      This application uses the
      nascent <a href="https://appframework.dev.java.net/">Swing
      Application Framework</a>. The framework covers lifecycle,
      actions, and tasks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the framework uses its own copy of swing-worker.jar
      instead of the one that is now in Java 6. Hopefully, this will
      be fixed in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the moment, the src distribution is downloaded into
      <code>/jars/src/java.net</code>. To
      build <code>AppFramework.jar</code> (after downloading a new
      distribution, for example), extract the zip file. For
      convenience, maintain the <code>AppFramework-src.zip</code>
      symbolic link to the zip file and the <code>AppFramework</code>
      link to the extracted directory so that <code>.classpath</code>
      files that reference the library's source doesn't have to change
      with new releases. In the <code>AppFramework</code> directory,
      run <code>ant jar</code>. Then copy
      both <code>dist/AppFramework.jar</code>
      and <code>lib/swing-worker.jar</code>
      into <code>/jars/runtime/java.net</code>. Optionally,
      run <code>ant javadoc</code> to build the documentation which
      you can find in <code>dist/javadoc</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For more information, please
      read <a href="https://appframework.dev.java.net/intro/">An
      Introduction to the Swing Application Framework API
      (JSR-296)</a> and
      the <a
      href="https://appframework.dev.java.net/nonav/javadoc.html">Swing
      Application Framework Javadoc</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Templates</h3>

    <p>
      Most of your panels should be subclasses
      of <a
      href="common/KeplerPanel.html"><code>KeplerPanel</code></a>
      which defines template methods to provide for a consistent
      structure throughout the codebase. If the panel is intended to
      be a top-level tab in the UI, then your panel should be a
      subclass of
      <a href="common/ToolPanel.html"><code>ToolPanel</code></a>,
      which itself is a subclass
      of <a
      href="common/KeplerPanel.html"><code>KeplerPanel</code></a>.
      You'll then
      call <a
      href="common/KeplerPanel.html#createUi()"><code>KeplerPanel.createUi()</code></a>
      in your constructor and override a handful of other methods
      from <a
      href="common/KeplerPanel.html"><code>KeplerPanel</code></a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Actions and Resources</h3>

    <p>
      All buttons and menu items should be created with the
      application framework's <code>@Action</code> annotation. This
      annotation, added to methods, creates actions that can be
      consumed by Swing components. These actions use specially named
      resources (shown below) to initialize the action's properties
      (like button text, tool tips, mnemonics, icons, and so on). If a
      component will be enabled or disabled depending on the state of
      the panel, then use the <code>enabledProperty</code> parameter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Use resources for strings that a user may see on the screen, in
      a dialog, or in log messages. For simplicity, do not use
      resources in exceptions that result in programmer error where
      the likelihood of a user seeing it is negligible. Use the
      application framework to obtain resources. In the example below,
      the first statement that obtains the <code>resourceMap</code> is
      usually not necessary as it is already provided by
      the <a
      href="common/KeplerPanel.html"><code>KeplerPanel</code></a>
      or <a href="common/ToolPanel.html"><code>ToolPanel</code></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is some code that demonstrates these things as well as the
      way that they are used in the codebase.
    </p>

    <pre>      private ResourceMap resourceMap = ApplicationContext.getInstance()
          .getResourceMap(getClass());
      <span style="color:red;font-style:italic">// Use for action name to avoid typos.</span>
      private static final String FOO = "foo";
      <span style="color:red;font-style:italic">// Avoid typos in @Action parameters and firePropertyChange calls.</span>
      private static final String ENABLED = "Enabled";
      <span style="color:red;font-style:italic">// Bound property, used by the @Action enabledProperty parameter.</span>
      private boolean fooEnabled;
      ...
      protected initComponents() {
          ...
          JLabel fooLabel = new JLabel();
          <span style="color:red;font-style:italic">// Feeds resource injection.</span>
          fooLabel.setName("fooLabel");
          <span style="color:red;font-style:italic">// Get action foo from framework.</span>
          JButton fooButton = new JButton(actionMap.get(FOO));
          ...
      }
      ...
      &#64;Action(enabledProperty = FOO + ENABLED)
      public void foo() {
          log.info(resourceMap.getString(FOO, "bar")); <span style="color:red;font-style:italic">// get resources manually</span>
          ...
          handleError(this, e, FOO);
      }

      public boolean isFooEnabled() {
          return fooEnabled;
      }

      public void setFooEnabled(boolean fooEnabled) {
          boolean oldValue = this.fooEnabled;
          this.fooEnabled = fooEnabled && <i>insert lots of conditions here</i>;
          firePropertyChange(FOO + ENABLED, oldValue, this.fooEnabled);
      }
</pre>

    <p>
      Every class has its own resource bundle within
      a <code>resource</code> sub-package, although the application
      framework will fall back
      to <code>gov.nasa.kepler.ui.resources.Ksoc.properties</code> if
      a resource cannot be found locally. The resource files
      themselves are organized by component and appear roughly in the
      order that the components appear on the screen. Here's the
      resource file for the example above.
    </p>

    <pre>      <span style="color:red;font-style:italic"># Text of JLabel which is injected in createUi().</span>
      fooLabel.text=Foo
      <span style="color:red;font-style:italic"># Properties for foo action.</span>
      foo.Action.text=Foo
      foo.Action.shortDescription=Foo
      <span style="color:red;font-style:italic"># Resource used manually.</span>
      foo=Fooing %s
      <span style="color:red;font-style:italic"># Resources used by handleError.</span>
      foo.failed=Could not foo %s
      foo.failed.secondary=Please try something else.</pre>

    <h3>Tasks</h3>

    <p>
      Use the application framework to carry out tasks. To launch a
      task, use the following code as an example:
    </p>

    <pre>
      &#64;Action(enabledProperty = RECALCULATE + ENABLED)
      public Task recalculate() {
          Task task = new QueryTask(constraintModel);
          task.setInputBlocker(new KeplerInputBlocker(resourceMap, task,
              BlockingScope.WINDOW, this));
          return task;
      }</pre>

    <p>
      If your task is sometimes measured in seconds instead of
      milliseconds, consider using an input blocker as shown in the
      example above.
      The <a
      href="common/KeplerInputBlocker.html"><code>KeplerInputBlocker</code></a>
      displays an hourglass cursor and if the task takes more than 250
      ms, displays a Kepler-standard dialog.

    <p>
      If you must run the task on the database thread, you need to
      explicitly launch the task yourself as in the following example.
      In the future, there may be a parameter for the @Action
      annotation which can be used instead (see next section).
    </p>

    <pre>
      &#64;Action(enabledProperty = RECALCULATE + ENABLED)
      public void recalculate() {
          Task task = new QueryTask(constraintModel);
          task.setInputBlocker(new KeplerInputBlocker(resourceMap, task,
              BlockingScope.WINDOW, this));
          ApplicationContext.getInstance().getTaskService(
              DatabaseTaskService.NAME).execute(task);
      }</pre>

    <p>
      See the framework's Javadoc for information on writing a task
      and existing code for examples.
    </p>

    <h3>Database Access</h3>

    <p>
      All database access <b>must</b> be performed on a single thread
      since the database session in that thread keeps track of all of
      the persistent objects. For now, this is done with the following
      call:

      <pre>      ApplicationContext.getInstance().getTaskService(
          DatabaseTaskService.NAME).execute(new TargetListSetLoadTask());</pre>

      Ultimately, it will also be possible to declare an Action as
      returning a Task and using an annotation parameter that
      indicates that
      the <a
      href="common/DatabaseTaskService.html#NAME"><code>DatabaseTaskService.NAME</code></a>
      thread should be used.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your <code>Task</code> implementation should be a subclass
      of <a
      href="common/DatabaseTask.html"><code>DatabaseTask</code></a>.
      You only need to implement <code>doInBackground</code> (which
      does the work) and <code>succeeded</code> (which updates a view
      directly or dispatches messages for other views to update
      themselves)
      as <a
      href="common/DatabaseTask.html"><code>DatabaseTask</code></a>
      provides implementations
      for <a
      href="common/DatabaseTask.html#failed(java.lang.Throwable)"><code>failed</code></a>
      and <a
      href="common/DatabaseTask.html#interrupted(java.lang.InterruptedException)"><code>interrupted</code></a>.
      Optionally, implement <code>cancelled</code> if your code allows
      the user to cancel the task and <code>finished</code> to perform
      work regardless if the task succeeded or not.
    </p>

    <h3>EventBus</h3>

    <p>
      Rather than couple components together, use the <b>EventBus</b>
      package. Components should register their interest in particular
      events by implementing <code>EventSubscriber</code>
      or <code>EventTopicSubscriber</code> and calling, for example:
    </p>

    <pre>
      <span style="color:red;font-style:italic">// Standard event. </span>
      EventBus.subscribe(StatusEvent.class, support);

      <span style="color:red;font-style:italic">// Topic-based event. </span>
      EventBus.subscribe(targetListTable.getSelectionTopic(), support);

      <span style="color:red;font-style:italic">// Parameterized event. </span>
      EventBus.subscribe(new TypeReference&lt;UpdateEvent&lt;TargetList&gt;&gt;() {
      }.getType(), targetListUpdateHandler);</pre>

    <p>
      To push the event on the bus, use:
    </p>

    <pre>
      <span style="color:red;font-style:italic">// Standard event. </span>
      EventBus.publish(new StatusEvent(TargetListSetsPanel.this).done());

      <span style="color:red;font-style:italic">// Topic-based event. </span>
      EventBus.publish(getSelectionTopic(), selection);

      <span style="color:red;font-style:italic">// Parameterized event. </span>
      EventBus.publish(new TypeReference&lt;UpdateEvent&lt;TargetList&gt;&gt;() {
      }.getType(), new UpdateEvent&lt;TargetList&gt;(
          UpdateEvent.Function.ADD_OR_UPDATE, targetList));</pre>

    <p>
      The documentation for the EventBus package can be downloaded
      from <a
      href="https://eventbus.dev.java.net/">https://eventbus.dev.java.net/</a>.
      The package documentation has an excellent description and
      examples.
    </p>

    <h3>Error Handling</h3>

    <p>
      Try to only print one stack trace in the log
      (with <code>log.error(message, e)</code>) for a particular
      error. This makes the log easier to read and it faster to
      diagnosis problems as there is less duplication to filter out.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A good rule of thumb is to use the form
      of <code>log.error</code> that prints a stack trace as soon as
      the exception is detected, typically when calling an API
      external to the <code>ui</code> project, unless the foreign
      method is known to already print a stack trace. Having logged
      the stack trace, the exception can then be percolated up,
      optionally logging new contextual information, but not
      displaying the stack, until a dialog is shown to the user. The
      exception should nearly always be wrapped in
      a <a href="common/UiException.html"><code>UiException</code></a>
      too, which plays well with
      the <a
      href="common/KeplerPanel.html"><code>KeplerPanel</code></a>
      templates. Most panel constructors and factory methods should
      throw
      an <a
      href="common/UiException.html"><code>UiException</code></a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When adding code that throws exceptions, explicitly throw these
      exceptions with expected message strings to see how those
      strings appear in the error dialog. Ensure the messages make
      sense, are helpful, and don't contain duplicate strings (which
      can happen if several callers wrap an exception and
      use <code>e.getMessage()</code> as the message).
    </p> 

    <p>
      Use <code>.failed</code> and <code>.failed.secondary</code>
      suffixes in the resource files for error messages that are
      displayed in dialogs
      with <a
      href="common/KeplerPanel.html#handleError(java.awt.Container,%20java.lang.Throwable,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.Object...)"><code>KeplerPanel.handleError()</code></a>.
      The former is used for the primary message and the latter is
      used for the secondary message as defined by section
      <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/hig-book/2.32/windows-alert.html">
        Alerts
      </a>
      in the HIG.
    </p>

    <h3>Jigloo GUI Builder</h3>
    
    <p>
      The Jigloo Eclipse plug-in is used to create all of the panels
      in the KSOC. The software can be downloaded
      from <a
      href="http://www.cloudgarden.com/jigloo/">Cloudgarden</a>. Check
      out
      the <a href="http://www.cloudgarden.com/forums.html">forums</a>
      too. If you use the evaluation copy, please don't check in the
      warning text that it inserts into your code. It might be
      expedient and helpful for you to bring your back-of-the-envelope
      design into my office so that we can lay out the components
      together with my licensed copy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are a few tips when creating components.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        By default, Jigloo creates an <code>initGUI</code> method;
        please rename it
        to <a
        href="common/KeplerPanel.html#initComponents()"><code>initComponents</code></a>
        (NetBeans style) in order to conform with our naming
        conventions.
      </li>
      <li>
        The current version hard-codes lots of widths and gaps.
        Using <code>GroupLayout</code>'s defaults, and calling the
        layout's <code>setAutoCreateContainerGaps(true)</code>, 
        <code>setAutoCreateGaps(true)</code>
        and <code>linkSize()</code> methods makes the components
        resizable and produces a more pleasing display.
      </li>
      <li>
        Other than that, try to avoid
        touching <a
        href="common/KeplerPanel.html#initComponents()"><code>initComponents</code></a>
        since it will make it harder to go back into Jigloo. Instead,
        add customization code to
        the <a
        href="common/KeplerPanel.html#configureComponents()"><code>configureComponents</code></a>
        method, defined by
        the <a
        href="common/KeplerPanel.html#createUi()"><code>KeplerPanel.createUi</code></a>
        template. See <code>TargetEditor</code> for a complex
        example.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Look and Feel</h3>

    <p>
      We're currently using the native look and feel in order to blend
      in with the GNOME desktop on the operator's consoles. This
      setting is controlled by
      the <code>Application.lookAndFeel</code> property in
      in <code>gov.nasa.kepler.ui.resources.Ksoc.properties</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a
      href="http://developer.gnome.org/hig-book/2.32/">GNOME
      Human Interface Guidelines 2.0</a> is required reading. It is
      chock full of excellent advice and guidelines. At the very
      least, skim the sample dialogs to see how panels should be
      generally laid out, and read the section
      on <a
      href="http://developer.gnome.org/hig-book/2.32/design-text-labels.html#layout-capitalization">capitalization</a>.
      The goal is for your panel to be usable and fit in with the rest
      of the application as well as the desktop.
    </p>

    <h3>Icons</h3>

    <p>
      We're currently using the default GTK icons
      (see <code>ksoc.properties</code>
      and <code>jars/gtk/gtk-icons.jar</code>). It would be nice to
      use the GTK names when accessing icons so that we can switch GTK
      themes and the icons would follow. However, we'd still need to
      fall back to alternative icons on other platforms that don't
      support GTK.
    </p>

    <h3>What Next</h3>

    <p>
      You can start the application by running <code>ant ksoc</code>
      at the top of the project.
    </p>
    <p>
      To start the application in Eclipse,
      visit <a href="Ksoc.html"><code>Ksoc.java</code></a>. This is
      the main class and contains the application framework's
      lifecycle methods such as <code>startup</code>. Run the Run As >
      Java Application command. You'll probably get complaints about
      properties and from log4j. To fix these, run the Run > Run
      command and edit the Ksoc configuration. Select the Arguments
      tab and add the following VM arguments:
    </p>

    <pre>
      -Dlog4j.configuration=file:etc/log4j.xml
      -Dconfig.propfile=etc/ui-dev.properties</pre>

    <p>
      If you need to add new panels to the KSOC, you have to consider
      whether the panel will have its own tab or will be just one pane
      of many in an existing tab.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically, each tab will get its own sub-package here, but that
      is only a guideline. For example, the Target Management tab is
      implemented by
      the <a
      href="cm/TargetManagementPanel.html"><code>TargetManagementPanel</code></a>
      class (a sub-class
      of <a href="common/ToolPanel.html"><code>ToolPanel</code></a>)
      and is found in
      the <a href="cm/package-summary.html"><code>cm</code></a>
      package. To see how a tab is inserted into the application,
      search for <code>targetmanagement</code> (ignoring case)
      in <a href="Ksoc.html"><code>Ksoc.java</code>
      and <code>Ksoc.properties</code></a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For other panels,
      see <a href="cm/TargetEditor.html"><code>TargetEditor</code></a>
      for an example of
      a <a
      href="common/KeplerPanel.html"><code>KeplerPanel</code></a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Odds & Ends</h3>

    <p>
      You can seed the database for the UI by running <code>ant
      seed-data</code> at the top of the project, but only after
      editing <code>etc/ui-dev.properties</code> and replacing my name
      with yours! If you want to seed the database with your own data,
      simply edit the <code>SeedData</code> class
      (in <code>test</code>), add your own <code>seedFoo</code> method
      at the end and call that method
      from <code>initializeTestDb</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, I like to keep the public APIs as clean as possible
      and avoid anonymous inner classes to keep code readable. To
      achieve both of these goals at the same time, I typically create
      an inner class called <code>Support</code> which implements
      various interfaces. If you think that this pattern would be
      useful in your code, I'd suggest naming your inner
      class <code>Support</code> as well and cut and paste the leading
      Javadoc from another <code>Support</code> inner class (they are
      all the same) to tell others not in the know what the class is
      for.
