header.text=First create target lists by pressing the New button \
    above the Target Lists table. \
    Then create a Target List Set for each target table definition \
    and incorporate the Target Lists you created previously. \

    a context menu will provide additional choices that do not appear \
    in the tool bars. \
    Most table headings and buttons have tool tips that appear \
    if you hover your  mouse above them.
