# Tests the load times for characteristics. This test clears and
# populates the CM_CHAR_TYPE and CM_CHAR tables for the data base user
# $USER/USER. Five data points are taken using varying percentages of
# the original data set, which should be in
# /path/to/$USER/char-load-test. The trimmed data sets are saved in
# the current directory, so you should run this in a file system that
# has at least 300 MB free.
