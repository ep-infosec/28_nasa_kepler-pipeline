  <h1>The Automated Feature Test (AFT) API</h1>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    Automated Feature Tests (AFTs) include the following elements: test
    data set descriptors, test data generators, and the AFTs themselves.
    The following sections describe each of these elements in turn.
  </p>

  <h3>Test Data Set Descriptors</h3>
  <p>
    A <i>Test Data Set Descriptor</i> describes a test data set used in
    a chain of test data generators and AFTs. You may be able to make
    use of existing descriptors, or you may write one of your own.
  </p>
  <p>
    For more information, please see
    the <a href="descriptor/package-summary.html">descriptor</a>
    package documentation.
  </p>

  <h3>Test Data Generators</h3>
  <p>
    Most AFTs have a prerequisite of a populated datastore. <i>Test Data
    Generators</i> are designed to fulfill this need. The HSQLDB files
    that are produced by these test data generators are found in
    <code>/path/to/aft/<i>module.name</i>/<i>test.descriptor</i>/hsqldb</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For more information, please see
    the <a href="AbstractTestDataGenerator.html">AbstractTestDataGenerator</a>
    or <a href="AbstractAutomatedFeatureTest.html">AbstractAutomatedFeatureTest</a>
    class documentation.
  </p>

  <h3>Automated Feature Tests (AFTs)</h3>
  <p>
    To create an AFT, subclass
    <a href="AutomatedFeatureTest.html">AutomatedFeatureTest</a>. See
    its class documentation or the class documentation for
    <a href="AbstractAutomatedFeatureTest.html">AbstractAutomatedFeatureTest</a>
    for more information on writing your AFT.
  </p>

  <h3>Seed Data</h3>
  <p>
    The database can be populated in an automated fashion by running
    code which creates and inserts the data using an appropriate
    create method from a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete)
    class.
  </p>
  <p>
    The database can also be populated by loading data captured in
    HSQL scripts (seen in the .hsql files above). HSQL scripts are
    distinct from SQL; they contain an internal HSQLDB representation
    of the database contents that is deceptively similar to SQL.
    However, they cannot be directly loaded as if they are SQL but
    must instead be assembled into an internal snapshot of the
    database contents that are loaded when the HSQLDB database is
    started. This is typically accomplished in the AFTs by calling
    the <code>initializeServices</code> method.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a test data generator or AFT needs to call pipeline modules to
    populate the database, the <code>PipelineConfigurator</code> class
    can be used to supply the information needed to run those pipeline
    modules. See its documentation for details and existing seed data
    classes for examples. This code is typically placed in a <i>seed
    data</i> class.
  </p>
  <p>
    By convention, a seed data class refers to a class with
    a <code>SeedData</code> suffix that includes
    a <code>loadSeedData</code> method which creates the pipeline.
  </p>
