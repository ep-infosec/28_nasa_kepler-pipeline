  <h1>Test Data Set Descriptors</h1>

  <p>
    A <i>Test Data Set Descriptor</i> describes a test data set used
    in a chain of test data generators and AFTs. You may be able to
    make use of the existing descriptors listed above, or you may
    write one of your own.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you write one of your own, start by extending the abstract
    class
    <a href="TestDataSetDescriptor.html">
      TestDataSetDescriptor</a> or any other existing descriptor.
    Next, add your descriptor to the
    <a href="TestDataSetDescriptorFactory.html">
      TestDataSetDescriptorFactory</a>.
  </p>
